On laptop:
Intruder detection Mobilenetv2 notebook is used for training. I have used pretrained mobilenetv2 model. 
You can use any other model available in torch pakage
Other file which is test.ipynb is used for testing on random images to test accuracy and inference


On Jetson
Same files can be used on Jetson device
Training using Jetson will be slow
